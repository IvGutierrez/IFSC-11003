    <h2 class = "reflection">Semster reflection and revised project feedback</h2>
    <p class = "reflection">While CSS made want to slam my head agansit the wall sometimes, overall, I enjoyed learning about HTML and CSS, and I feel 
      like it is a very appliacble skill that can help me with my job prospects. I felt like I did good learning about HTML, and certian parts of
      CSS felt quite natural such as the grid system. One part I struggled with a lot is how CSS and HTML connected, it feels a lot more
      "vibe based" how all the things are linked compared to something like CSS or Python.</p>
    <p class = "reflection"> My mother reviewed the site, and felt like the tables on the menu page and the hyperlinks on the 
      header looked ugly, so I decided to improve those parts. For the hyperlinks I removed the underlines, the list dots, and added
      boxes to them and added gold highlight everytime you hover over them. I wanted to add more gold accents to the site but I couldn't 
      find a way to add them aside from the hyperlink highlight. For the tables, I collapsed the border, made the top black and white,
      added the gray and white rows, and made the rows grayed whenever you hovered over them</p>
    
    <h2 class = "reflection">Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p class = "reflection">Progressive Enhancementis the desgin process of focusing on the content/HTML first, then CSS, and then finally JavaScript
      It's important since follow this desgin philoshipy forces desginers to plan a rich and stable core instead of messing around with new tech that 
      leaves people with old devices a website that barely works. I feel like the Video Game industry could follow this philosophy, but instead they 
      large developers such as Activision make unoptimized games that take over half your hard drive, or run badly on everything but the top 1% of computers.</p>
      <p class = "reflection">Another thing that progressive enchancement is useful for is internet connections like this <a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/its-about-time-i-tried-to-explain-what-progressive-enhancement-actually-is/">article</a> mentions.
      Due to my job, sometimes I end up in somewhat remote locations or in buildings that apparently build their roof with lead,
      which leads to dodgy internet connection, which means apps and webpages loaded with an overly desgined page take forever to load. </p>
